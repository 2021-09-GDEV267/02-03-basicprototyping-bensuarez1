 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
For my own prototype, I went ahead and added at least one element from each of the three prototypes we have previously done: Roll-a-Ball, Mission Demolition & Apple Picker.
In this game, the goal is for the ball (player) to collect all 4 blue items/collectibles in the level without getting stuck between walls/slabs.
The two elements I used from Roll-a-Ball is 1. the ball itself that players can move left & right using input keys, and 2. PickUps/Items that can be obtained by the player when collided against each other.
The element I used from Apple Picker is the 'score' count, which gives points for each item collected.
And the element that I used from Mission Demolition is the walls and slabs that can be knocked down when the player/ball collides against them, similar to how the 'projectile' knocked down the castles in Mission Demolition.
The design frameworks of this prototype influenced my decision making process because it allowed me to explore different mechanics on my own (ones that weren't exactly used in the previous prototypes).
